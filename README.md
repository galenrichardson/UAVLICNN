# UAV_LiCNN
Code outlined in the UAV LiCNN Paper
Welcome to the repository containing codes used in the UAV LiCNN Paper. 

CCMEO 380 DRONE LiCNN FRAC is the training script for UAV LiCNN

DRONE_200_LICNN_Predict_Frac is the prediction script, where you use UAV LiCNN to predict Lichen in a drone orthomosaic

Merge_tiles_3x3 is a script which was used to create the training mosaics

UAV_LiCNN_ENV is the python environment used to create and run this code

lichen_DRONE_333_VTAUG are the best training weights for the LiCNN model we achieved.
